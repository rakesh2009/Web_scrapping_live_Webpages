# Web_scrapping_live_Webpages
Performed web scrapping on live &amp; dynamic web pages using python, Beautifulsoup &amp; Requests libraries

**Background:**

Webscrapping is used by companies to read & extract the required information from online webpages for performing the downstream activities such as

a) Price Monitoring

b) Market Research

c) News Monitoring

d) Sentiment Analysis

e) Email Marketing

**Problem Statement :**

How to read and get the required information from the a live & dynamic webpage. 


Solution:

To tackle this problem I have implemented the K-means clustering
Firstly, I applied the K-means clustering without dimensionality reduction
Secondly, I applied the K-means clustering with dimensionality reduction (Using PCA), which improves performance of model by feature extraction.
In addition to that I found out
a) which cluster has max. articles(before & after implementing PCA) b) top 50 words in entertainment cluster and printing last 50th word (before & after implementing PCA)

Dependencies:

Python 3+, jupyter notebbook, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, K-means, PCA

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to gain insights, develop competency & help others in

a) Pratical implementation of K-Means clustering using python code

b) Clustering of News articles with the help of K-Means alogarithm for finding the suitable & related topics clusters

c) Dimensionality reduction using PCA.
